/**
 * Makes a task row somewhere another task can be dropped.
 *
 * The row answers to two gestures and says which one it is about to take: a
 * line at the seam for a task arriving in its place, the same line pushed in
 * to where a subtask starts for a task going inside it. Reordering is offered
 * wherever the list around the row keeps an order it can write — which is
 * every list but a board column — and a straight drag anywhere else passes
 * through to the group behind, which is still how a task is given a day.
 *
 * A row that cannot take the task stays a target but never lights up, and the
 * drop onto it does nothing: falling through to the group would file the task
 * somewhere nobody aimed.
