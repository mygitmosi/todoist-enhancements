 * screen — and the foot of a list is exactly where the work nobody has dealt
 * with sits. The pickers in the composer and the task panel already measure
 * the room below them and flip above when the list would not fit; this is that
 * rule, given to the row menus that were never handed it.
 *
 * The menu changes height while it is open — the schedule field grows a list
 * of suggestions under it as you type — so it is measured again whenever it
 * resizes rather than only when it appears.
 *
 * The room is the room you can see, not the window's. A board scrolls
 * sideways, and a box that scrolls on one axis clips on both, so a menu
 * hanging below the last card of a short board was cut off by the board while
 * the window had plenty of space under it. The nearest box that clips is
 * measured along with the window, and when neither side has room for the
 * whole menu it opens on the roomier one and scrolls inside itself, so every
 * line of it can be reached without scrolling the board. The same box cut the
 * menus of a first column off on the left, so they are slid back inside it.
 *
 * It is keyed on which menu is open rather than whether one is: going from
 * the "⋯" menu to Schedule or Move keeps a menu open, and the placement and
 * the size being watched were the "⋯" menu's.
