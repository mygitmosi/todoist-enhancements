/**
 * Whether this account has been through the first run.
 *
 * The obvious place for this is the preferences, and the preferences are the
 * wrong place: disconnecting clears IndexedDB and resets them, so signing out
 * and back in would present the walkthrough again to somebody who has already
 * done it and already has the settings it offers to choose. Local storage
 * survives that, which is why the flag lives here rather than beside the
 * settings it is about.
 *
 * It is keyed by Todoist user id rather than being a single boolean, for the
 * other half of the same problem: a browser is not a person. A second account
 * signing in on the same machine has genuinely never seen this, and deserves
 * to be asked; the first one does not have to answer twice.
 *
 * The id is Todoist's own and is never sent anywhere — it is already in the
 * snapshot this app holds on the device.
