/**
 * The date "Skip to next occurrence" will land on, for the rules where that is
 * not a guess (#153).
 *
 * `recurrence.ts` is explicit that this app does not resolve a repeat rule:
 * Todoist does, and it is the only place that gets every rule right across time
 * zones and completions. This is the one narrow exception, so the schedule menu
 * can say where a task is about to go. It earns that by saying nothing whenever
 * it is not sure, because a wrong date shown next to a button is worse than no
 * date:
 *
 * - only plain rules are read: every day, every N days or weeks, every week,
 *   every weekday, and every <weekday>[, <weekday>...], with an optional time
 *   of day on the end, which does not change the date;
 * - a task that is already late gets no date: where Todoist puts a late
 *   occurrence is not something to assume;
 * - `every!` counts from today, which is only a plain step for the simple
 *   day and week rules; its weekday forms are left out;
 * - anything else, a bound, a month, a position ("last friday"), gives null.
