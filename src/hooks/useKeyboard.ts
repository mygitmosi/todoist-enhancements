/**
 * The whole of the keyboard, in one place.
 *
 * It was in three before — a handler in `App` for `⌘K`, `q` and undo, the
 * rows' own Enter, and the pickers' own arrows — and the moment a plain letter
 * started meaning something, the order those handlers ran in became the
 * feature. Two listeners both answering `q` is not a bug you find by reading
 * either one of them.
 *
 * ## The cursor is focus
 *
 * A row is already a `role="button"` with a tab stop and an Enter handler, so
 * the row the keyboard is on is simply the row that has focus. Nothing has to
 * be kept in sync with anything, a screen reader announces the row without
 * being told to, and Escape out of the task panel lands back on the row it was
 * opened from — the dialog shell already returns focus to wherever it came
 * from, which is the behaviour the issue asked for, unwritten.
 *
 * The mouse pointer is not the cursor. Hovering a task and pressing a key
 * was tried (#90) and left out on purpose: with the pointer resting on a
 * list, typing a search that starts with `e` completed whatever task was
 * under it. Arrows, J/K, Tab or a task opened and closed again put the cursor
 * on a row; the pointer never does.
 *
 * The cursor is not carried between pages. Restoring one on arrival would mean
 * taking focus on every navigation, which fights anyone tabbing through the
 * page for a keystroke they did not ask for; arriving on a page, the first
 * Down goes to the top of it.
 *
 * ## Letters are commands on a row, and text everywhere else
 *
 * Todoist's task shortcuts need a task — `e`, `t`, `v`, `x`, `1`–`4` act on
 * the one the cursor is on. With no cursor there is no task to act on, so the
 * same letters are what they look like: typing, which opens the search with
 * the letter already in it. One sentence covers every key, which is the most
 * that can be said for any mapping that has both.
 *
 * Letters Todoist gives a meaning this app has no equivalent for are left
 * alone rather than invented: `l` labels a task and `c` comments on one, and
 * neither exists here. Bound to nothing they are still useful — they start a
 * search, like every other letter.
 *
 * ## Going somewhere is `g` and a letter
 *
 * Todoist's arrangement, kept for the reason it exists: a bare letter per
 * destination would take `w`, `u`, `s` and `i` away from typing, and typing is
 * how you reach a project. A prefix costs one key and leaves the alphabet
 * alone — which is also why `/` can stay as a second way into the search
 * without ever being mistaken for a word.
