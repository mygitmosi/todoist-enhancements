 *
 * The window asked for is twice the range, because every chart that compares
 * "this month" to "last month" would otherwise need a second round trip to say
 * anything. The result is split at the range's start before it is returned.
 *
 * What comes back always belongs to the range asked for: while the next one is
 * loading, or after it failed, the last one's values are not handed out under
 * the new one's name, and an answer that arrives after the person has moved on
