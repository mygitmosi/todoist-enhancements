## New features for Todoist

Everything here is stored in properties Todoist already has: an estimate is a
label (or Todoist's own duration, which is read too), "anytime this week" is a label, and the rest is projects, sections,
priorities and dates. Open the official app afterwards and nothing looks
unusual. If this project stopped working tomorrow your data would be
untouched, because it never lived anywhere else.

- **Today / Anytime this week / Someday:** Todoist asks which day a task
  belongs to, and most work has no good answer — it belongs to *this week*,
  and picking Tuesday for it is a guess you spend the week correcting. So
  there are three commitments instead of one. Today is what you have actually
  dated. Anytime this week is what you have committed to without pinning to an
  afternoon. Someday is what you are not committing to yet — out of the week
  but not out of the app, read back to you at the weekly review so it never
  quietly becomes a graveyard. On the page itself, tasks that have sat there
  for months (three by default, 1 to 12 in Settings) are gathered at the top in
  a group called Gathering dust, each with three actions: This week, Keep or
  Delete. A task you keep stays in Someday on purpose and comes back only
  after another full delay; that is remembered on the device, and nothing is
  written to Todoist for it.

- **Eisenhower matrix:** the same tasks, sorted into four quadrants instead of
  a list — urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not
  important, neither. Urgency comes from the due date (you choose how close
  counts as urgent), importance from priority (P1 only, or P1 and P2). Switch
  to a flat list, filter by workspace, and decide whether Someday tasks count.

- **Daily and weekly review:** a few minutes, one question at a time, with an
  end. The daily one walks what is late, your mail, the Inbox, what you
  committed to this week without naming a day, what has no estimate, and what
  today weighs against the hours you have. Each step is answered from inside
  it, so you never leave the review to act on what it just told you. The
  weekly one closes the week and opens the next: what you finished, the week
  in numbers, what is late, which projects have gone quiet.

- **Task durations:** write down how long a task will take — `25`, `1h15`,
  `90 min`. Every page then carries a line saying how many tasks are on it,
  how much time they add up to, and what share of the capacity you set for
  that day or week. That last figure is a load pill: green, amber, over. A day
  filled to 140% says so before you start it, not at six in the evening. A
  parent whose open subtasks all have a duration takes their sum, written to
  the task so Todoist shows it too; with one missing it keeps its own, or shows
  the partial sum as computed. Anything still
  unestimated is counted separately and listed in one place so you can fill a
  page of them in one pass. A duration set in Todoist's own field counts too,
  with the source chosen in Settings taking priority when both are present.
  Tags are the default and work on every plan; editing a tag estimate keeps
  Todoist’s calendar duration. Duration mode is blocked on free accounts.
  Every native estimate write is checked against server data; a dropped or
  refused duration switches back to tags and recovers the estimate. An
  unavailable verification stays queued for the next sync. Durations in days
  are ignored; estimates of 24 hours or more keep their exact minute value.
  Settings offers a conversion preview for open tasks, including subtasks,
  with skipped conflicts and a result per batch. Converting timed durations
  to tags preserves calendar blocks; untimed durations are cleared. Account
  labels and completed tasks are never deleted by conversion.

- **I have time:** a pill next to the load figure on My week, projects, tags,
  the Inbox and Someday. Pick how long you have, 5 minutes to an hour or any
  duration you type, and a panel on the right lists the tasks that fit, by
  when they are due: overdue, today, tomorrow, this week, no date. It looks in
  the page you are on or everywhere, never guesses at a task with no estimate
  (it counts them, and offers to estimate them), and leaves the page behind it
  exactly as it was. Nothing is changed and nothing is remembered after a
  reload.

- **Checklists:** lines like `- [ ] item` in a task's description show as small
  checkboxes in the task panel, with "3 of 7" beside the description. Ticking
  one changes only that line, so the same text still reads fine in Todoist's
  own apps (which may show the lines as plain text). Editing is by rows rather
  than syntax: Enter adds the next item, Enter on an empty one leaves the
  list, Backspace at its start makes it plain text, and `[]` and a space starts
  a list, in the panel and in the new task window. Task rows never show the
  checklist lines.

- **Folders:** group projects inside a folder the way Todoist's own apps do —
  a collapsible row you can expand or collapse on its own, in your personal
  projects as much as in any team workspace. Drop a project onto a folder to
  file it inside.

- **Quick tasks on top of the list:** anything short enough to *do* rather
  than plan, gathered into its own bucket at the top of the week — under five
  minutes, or tagged `quick`. It sits at the top because that is when it is
  useful: the five minutes before a meeting are the five minutes those tasks
  are for. A task tagged quick but estimated at forty minutes is not quick, so
  it stays out and is reported as a contradiction instead. The same group
  leads a project, a tag, the Inbox and Someday, with the tasks that are late,
  due today or without a date (a quick task due next month stays where it is);
  each row says which section or project it comes from, and nothing is listed
  twice. On a board it is a blue first column, to look at rather than to drop tasks on. One switch in Settings turns it off everywhere.

- **Visible subtasks:** drawn under their parent in the list, indented, rather
  than hidden behind a count you have to open the task to see. The parent
  shows how many are done and its estimate is the sum of theirs. They can be
  made and unmade by dragging — pull a row a little to the right over another
  and it goes inside it; pull a subtask out to the left and it is a task of
  its own again. The task composer works the same way: add subtasks inline
  while you write the parent, each one its own editable row, and they are all
  created together when you save.

- **Project icons:** pick an icon for a project from a searchable catalog,
  next to the existing colour picker. It is saved as real Todoist data, so it
  follows the project between devices, not just this browser.

- **Dashboard:** a board that changes with the period you pick. A day shows
  the hours you finished things in, a week adds its shape and a comparison
  with the one before, a quarter and a year read month by month. Edit layout
  lets you put the cards in the order you want, with the mouse or the keyboard,
  and Reset to default puts them back. The focus score weights
  what you finished by its priority — the only question worth asking about a
  finished week: whether the effort went where it mattered, or into whatever
  was easiest to close.

- **Better logbook:** what you actually finished, grouped by day, and filtered
  by several projects and priorities at once rather than one at a time. It
  shares the period control with the dashboard, so the two always describe
  the same window.

- **Custom themes:** ten accent colours plus one you pick yourself, every one
  drawn in light *and* dark and checked for contrast rather than chosen by
  eye. Dark mode is not a second-class version of the theme — it is the theme.
  Light, dark, or whatever the device is set to.

- **Things to settle:** the contradictions no app should resolve on its own —
  a task both dated and labelled for the week, two estimates on one task, a
  quick task estimated at forty minutes. Each is listed with the options that
  match each possible intent, and nothing changes until you choose one.

- **The keyboard, and a phone:** arrows walk the list, Enter opens a task, `E`
  finishes it, `T` schedules it, `G` then a letter goes somewhere, and typing
  anything else starts a search — Todoist's own keys wherever Todoist has one,
  with `?` for the list. On a phone, swipe a task aside for its actions and
  hold it for the rest, the two gestures a phone has in place of a pointer
  hovering over a row.

## …and what you already know from Todoist

- **Drag and drop:** a task onto a day, a project, a tag, a section, a board
  column, or another task. In the sidebar, projects reorder by dragging and nest
  by dragging one a little to the right. Dropped straight onto a row, a task
  takes that row's place, and the order is written back to Todoist rather than
  into a corner of this app. Every destination has one fixed meaning, every drop
  says what it did, and every drop can be undone.

- **List and board views:** with grouping, sorting and filtering behind one
  Display control, remembered separately for each page.

- **Natural language in the task composer:** `Call Marc tomorrow at 9h p1 #Work
  @quick (25)` — the date, project, priority, tag and estimate are marked
  inside the field as you type, and fill the fields underneath, so you see
  what it understood before you commit. Click a mark, or press Backspace
  against it, and that reading turns back into ordinary text. Recurring dates
  use Todoist's own grammar — `every monday`, `every 3 days`, `every!` —
  handed to Todoist to resolve rather than guessed at here.

- **Projects, sections, tags and favourites:** a page for each, nested and
  ordered by dragging, with the Inbox and Upcoming where you expect them. A
  section has a menu: edit, move to another project, duplicate with its tasks,
  copy its link, archive or delete.

- **Search:** `⌘K`, or just start typing. It covers tasks, projects, sections,
  tags and every view in the app, which makes it the fastest way to anywhere.

- **Multi-select:** `⌘`-click, with one bar at the foot of the window to give the
  lot a date, a project, a tag or a priority.

- **Markdown in descriptions:** rendered in the list and in the task panel.

- **And the rest:** undo (`⌘Z`) for a move, a completion, a deletion or a drop,
  with a deleted task coming back with its subtasks. Offline, with changes
  queued and sent when you reconnect, and installable as an app. English and
  French, and settings for the things people disagree about.

## How to use it

1. Open **[todoistenhanced.julesbertolino.fr](https://todoistenhanced.julesbertolino.fr)**.
2. Press **Explore with demo data** to look around a made-up workspace without
   an account. Nothing is sent anywhere.
3. To use your own account, press **Continue with Todoist** and accept on
   Todoist's page. The app then appears in Todoist → Settings → Integrations,
   where it can be removed at any time. If you prefer, **Use an API token
   instead** still takes a token copied from [Todoist → Settings → Integrations
   → Developer](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).

There is no server, no database and no account beyond your Todoist one. The
browser talks to the Todoist API directly, sign-in included (OAuth with PKCE,
no client secret). Your access is stored in your own browser and is only ever
sent to Todoist. A copy of your workspace and anything you changed offline sit
in IndexedDB on that device; your settings also sit in a comment on your
Todoist Inbox, so they follow you to another browser.

## Building it

React 18, TypeScript and Vite. Zustand for state, `idb` for IndexedDB,
`@dnd-kit` for drag and drop, `date-fns` for dates, `vite-plugin-pwa` so it can
be installed. No UI or CSS framework.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Node 22, pinned in .nvmrc
npm run build    # a static site in dist/, see docs/deploying.md
npm run lint     # ESLint, including React hook rules
npm test         # unit tests on the rules (Vitest)
npm run e2e      # demo journeys in a browser (Playwright); add --headed to watch
```

The journeys need Playwright's Chromium: `npx playwright install chromium`
once on a new machine. GitHub runs lint, the typecheck, the unit tests and a build
on every push, and the journeys on every pull request.

### Self-hosting

"Continue with Todoist" identifies the app by a file it hosts,
`oauth/client.json`, and Todoist only sends people back to the address that
file names. The build writes it for the official site unless told otherwise,
so a copy on your own domain has to be built for that domain:

```bash
PUBLIC_URL=https://your.domain/ npm run build   # include the subfolder, if any
```

The file must be reachable over HTTPS at `https://your.domain/oauth/client.json`,
since Todoist fetches it. A copy built for another address says so on its
sign-in screen instead of sending you to Todoist's "Invalid redirect URI".
Signing in with an API token works anywhere, with none of this.

I built this for myself, so it is shaped around one person's habits — that is
the main thing it needs help with. If you have an idea, open an issue and say
how you plan your week. The most useful thing you can tell me is what you do
that this app makes difficult.

Pull requests are open. The rules live in `src/domain` and depend on nothing
else, so most behaviour can be changed without touching the interface.
